### Android application for "Smart recharge suggestion based on user call habits and network usage".    

**Tell us what your idea is.   
Describe in 250 words what the feature or service will do and how you’ll use Machine Learning to push the bar:**  
<br/>
<br/>

*As we know mobile is an easier way to connect with anyone. And this is only possible if mobile has balance/recharge. Choose a good plan for the phone which fulfills the need is the hectic job for most of users. In general, they simply choose a plan which is in demand in market (popular plan) without compare their actual need. They almost choose the under fit or over fit plan NOT the exact one.

I propose the solution that will be the on device ML based Android application which will help the user to make a decision while recharging the phone by giving the insight of the data usage and call. Also, give the suggestion among all the plans available based on On-device ML.

I plan to implement a machine learning model using Firebase, Keras and Tensorflow lite in the app. 
My plan is to train the model based on the user's call duration, data usage and preference recharge/history plan. Once the model is trained then I will integrate the model with the app to give smart recharge/plan suggestion while next recharge life cycle.
It will become a good outcome for "On-device ML".*

**Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.   
Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include:**  
1. **any potential sample code you’ve already written,**
2. **a list of the ways you could use Google’s help,** 
3. **as well as the timeline on how you plan on bringing it to life by May 1, 2020.**
<br/>

*I did not started working on the project. I am new in Machine Learning to Android Development. 
To speed up the process, I have to work with under expert who knows the ML algorithm and deployment on Android for running sample offline. We really hope to solve the problem and hope to make this product widely accessible.
I have worked on Android TV for finding user genre based on the user watching history. I really want to take the same experience for mobile recharge. It will solve the problems who really want good suggestions.*

**How Google could help us achieve the goal :**  
1. **Assign us a Mentor for the project**   
2. **Some software could be made free for experimenting purposes**  
3. **Help us reach a wide audience**  
4. **Help in spreading the technology to every part of the world and make it feasible**  
5. **Data set for the project**

**Tell us about you.  
A great idea is just one part of the equation; we also want to learn a bit more about you. Share with us some of your other projects so we can get an idea of how we can assist you with your project.**  
  
*Hello! I am Prafulla Malviya a professional Android developer in India.  I am new in ML. I have done some POC for Android TV based on ML for different clients.
I tried to figure out the views genre based on logs. Also, tried to show the annotate the video. Find the target ads for the audience etc..
I want to showcase "Smart recharge suggestion based on user call habits and network usage".*
